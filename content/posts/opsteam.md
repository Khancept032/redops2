We decided on using Pythonanywhere as our production environment, as it was a easy to use, and free service for the size project that we are committing to.
Python anywhere has a simplistic basis for uploading files, and allowing WebApps to function on its system. Working as the Ops team was interesting, as it was
a disconnect between the development of the code, and the final production phase. From the managerial perspective it was also interesting to see how the communication
between managers was so vital, as without any direction between the two teams, nothing would get done without major issues.
