      <p>GROUP PROJECT #1: Deploy a webapp, oldstyle</p>

<p>The class will be divided into groups of 6â€“10 students each. These groups will be split into Dev and Ops teams. Each group is responsible to deliver a running Python webapp (e.g., Hyde, Hugo, etc.) by the due date. The application must be modified in some way so that the appearance of the interface is visibly different from the default code as published on GitHub.com. Additionally, since this is a CMS, there should be at least three pages with original content in the final product.</p>

<p>RULES:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Dev team is responsible for any coding. They will make the necessary alterations to the interface design, and also create the content that will be duplicated in the production environment.</p></li>

<li><p>The Ops team is responsible to create and manage the production environment that will host the Python app (including OS and any required services, like databases). This can be done on a VM from the student virtual environment, a local machine to which you have access, or using another server to which you have access.</p></li>

<li><p>The Dev team cannot touch the production boxes.</p></li>

<li><p>The Ops team must take the prepared application and related data from the Dev team and deploy it, and the result must match what the Dev team sees on their development environment (both the production and development environments will be examined to judge success).</p></li>

<li><p>Both teams will be assigned a leader from within the team. Cross-team communication may only happen via email, and only through each team leader (no direct conversations between Dev and Ops team members!)</p></li>
